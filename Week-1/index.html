        <h1>History</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Tennis is believed to have originated during 12th or 13th century in France. However, it was played by
                Major Walter C. Wingfield, in an hourglass shaped court in 1873 in Great Britain. It seems to have
                evolved from similar ancient sports like court tennis, squash racquets and badminton.
            </li>
            <li>In 1877, the All England Croquet Club held a Tennis championship in a rectangular court with rules
                similar to that of modern Tennis. It quickly spread to America, Britain, and later to other parts of the
                world.
            </li>
            <li> Davis Cup, an international tennis tournament, was held in 1900 to promote the game all over the world.
            </li>
            <li>On March 1st, 1913, International Tennis Federation (ITF), the international governing body of Tennis
                was established. It formulates rules to be followed by all the players participating in competitions
                throughout the world. It also sets guidelines, defines the kind of equipment used in the sport, and
                defines court dimensions.
            </li>
            <li>Tennis is a sport played among two players or two pairs of players competing with each other in a
                rectangular tennis court with fixed boundaries. The two sides of the court are separated with a net. The
                sport involves shooting a tennis ball towards the other side of the court with a tennis racket. The ball
                has to fall within the court boundaries. Players gain a point when the opposite team or player fails to
                deliver the ball to the opponent.
            </li>
            <li>Tennis tests players in delivering the ball in the intended direction and in defending the ball
                delivered by their opponent.

    <section id="Game Overview">
        <h1>Game Overview</h1>
        <h2>Basic Rule</h2>
        <ul>The game starts with a coin toss to determine which player must serve first and which side they want to
            serve from.
            <li>The server must then serve each point from alternative sides on the base line. At no point must the
                server’s feet move in front of the baseline on the court prior to hitting their serve.
            </li>
            <li> If the server fails to get their first serve in they may take advantage of a second serve. If they
                again fail to get their second serve in then a double fault will be called and the point lost.
            </li>
            <li> If the server clips the net but the ball goes in the service area still then let is called and they get
                to take that serve again without penalty. If the ball hits the net and fails to go in the service area
                then out is called and they lose that serve.
            </li>
            <li>The receiver may stand where they wish upon receipt of the serve. If the ball is struck without the
                serve bouncing then the server will receive the point.
            </li>
            <li> Once a serve has been made the amount of shots between the players can be unlimited. The point is won
                by hitting the ball so the opponent fails to return it in the scoring areas.
            </li>
            <li> Points are awarded in scores of 15, 30 and 40. 15 represent 1 point, 30 = 2 and 40 = 3. You
            </li>
            <li>need 4 points to win a game. If a game lands on 40-40 it’s known as deuce. From deuce a player needs to
                win 2 consecutive points to win the game. After winning one point from deuce they player is on
                advantage. If the player wins the next point they win the game, if they lose it goes back to deuce.
            </li>
            <li>To win the set a player must win 6 games by 2 or more. The opening sets will go to a tie break if its
                ends up 6-6 where players play first to 7 points. The final set will not have a tie break and requires
                players to win by two games with no limits.
            </li>
            <li>If a player touches the net, distracts his opponent or impedes in anyway then they automatically lose
                the point.
            </li>
            <li> The ball can hit any part of the line for the point to be called in, outside the line and the ball is
                out.
            </li>
            <li>The balls in a tennis match are changed for new balls every 6 games
            </li>
            <li>A player loses a point if they fail to return the ball in either the correct areas on the court, hits
                the net and doesn’t go into opponent’s area or fails to return the ball before it bounces twice in their
                half.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Score</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You need to score four points to win a game of tennis. </li>
            <li>The points are known as 15 (1 point), 30 (two points), 40 (three points) and the fourth would result in
                the winning point and the end of that game. </li>
            <li>If the scores went to 40-40 this would be known as deuce. When a game reaches deuce the player must then
                win by two clear points.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Players & Equipment</h2>
        <p>
            A tennis match can be played by either one player on each side – a singles match – or two players on each
            side – a doubles match. The rectangular shaped court has a base line (at the back), service areas (two
            spaces just over the net in which a successful serve must land in) and two tram lines down either side. A
            singles match will mean you use the inner side tram line and a doubles match will mean you use the outer
            tram line.

            A court can be played on four main surfaces including grass, clay, hard surface and carpet. Each tournament
            will choose one surface type and stick without throughout. All that is required in terms of equipment is a
            stringed racket each and a tennis ball.
